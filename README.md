# swEn

A toy 2d Swift engine based on SDL and chipmunk2d
written in Swift and developed on linux.

A video of it in action is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCllcwLsUBs&feature=youtu.be)
though still very much a work in progress and does nothing interesting yet.

### TODO
[ ] Finish chipmunk2d integration, sprites classes that   
unify the physics world and the rendered world.   
[ ] TMX loader (possibly based off libtmx)   
[ ] Controller support   
[ ] Network support   
[ ] Drop the one or two files dependent on Foundation   
[ ] Redsign the content pipeline stuff so its easily extendable
